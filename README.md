# Block-X Smart Contract

The Block-X smart contract is the backbone of the Block-X decentralized application (dApp), built on the Binance Smart Chain network. This contract facilitates the posting, deletion, and tipping functionalities within the Block-X platform, allowing users to interact with each other in a decentralized manner.

## Key Features:

1. **Bloc Posting**: Users can create and post blocs, akin to tweets on social media platforms, directly onto the blockchain. Each bloc is timestamped and permanently stored on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

2. **Bloc Deletion**: Users have the ability to delete their own blocs, providing them with control over their content and privacy. Deleted blocs are removed from the platform, maintaining the integrity of the user experience.

3. **Wallet Tipping**: The contract enables users to tip each other using cryptocurrency directly from their wallets. This feature fosters engagement and appreciation within the community, allowing users to support content creators and contributors.

4. **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users, the Block-X contract supports interactions from 250+ wallets, ensuring scalability without compromising performance or user experience.

5. **Security**: The contract is built with security in mind, leveraging the robustness of the Binance Smart Chain network to safeguard user transactions and data.

## Technology Stack:

- **Solidity**: The contract is implemented using the Solidity programming language, specifically designed for writing smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

- **Binance Smart Chain**: The contract operates on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain network optimized for fast and low-cost transactions.

- **ThirdWeb Library**: Block-X utilizes the ThirdWeb library for enhanced functionality and ease of development. ThirdWeb simplifies smart contract deployment and interaction, making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications.

## Usage:

The Block-X contract can be interacted with through the Block-X decentralized application (dApp), providing users with a seamless and intuitive platform to engage with the blockchain. Users can post, delete, and tip blocs directly through the dApp's user interface, with all interactions executed securely on the blockchain.

## Deployment:

To deploy the Block-X smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Install Node Modules:

    `npm install`

2. Install ThirdWeb library:

    `npm install thirdweb`

3. deploy the Block-X smart contract:

    `thirdweb deploy`


Once deployed, interact with your contract using ThirdWeb's Website.


Feel free to adjust the instructions based on your actual deployment process and usage of the ThirdWeb library.
